# AMOS-Abdominal-multi-organ-segmentation-from-CT-MRI-scans-using-Deep-learning-Model

I am training the AMOS dataset using various deep learning models for abdominal organ segmentation. This diverse dataset, which includes 500 CT and 100 MRI scans with detailed voxel-level annotations of 15 organs, provides a robust platform for evaluating segmentation algorithms across multiple clinical scenarios. By benchmarking state-of-the-art models, I aim to assess their performance on this challenging dataset and contribute to advancing research in medical image segmentation.
